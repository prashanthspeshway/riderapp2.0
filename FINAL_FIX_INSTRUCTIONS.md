# ðŸš¨ FINAL FIX - Rider Location Display

## Problem:
The `/api/rider/online` endpoint is being blocked by authentication middleware even though it should be public.

## Root Cause:
The auth middleware is checking `req.path` which is relative to the router mount point. When accessed via `/api/rider/online`, the `req.path` is `/online`, not `/api/rider/online`.

## Solution Applied:
1. Updated auth middleware to check for `/online` in the path
2. Moved `/online` route to the very top of the router (before other routes)
3. Added bypass logic in auth middleware

## Files Modified:
1. `backend/src/middleware/auth.js` - Added bypass for `/online` endpoint
2. `backend/src/routes/rider.routes.js` - Moved `/online` to top of public routes
3. `frontend/src/components/Map.js` - Using correct API URL with port 5000

## How to Apply Fix:
1. **Restart the backend server** - The changes require a server restart
2. The frontend will automatically reconnect
3. Riders should now appear on the map with bike/car icons

## Testing:
After restarting the backend, check:
- Browser console should show "âœ… Bypassing auth for /online endpoint" in backend logs
- No more 401 errors
- Riders should appear on the map

**The fix is in the code. Please restart your backend server to apply the changes.**
