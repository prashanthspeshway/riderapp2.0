# ✅ QUICK FIX - Backend Started!

## The Problem Was:
Your backend server (`localhost:5000`) was not running, so:
- Rider couldn't go online
- Socket couldn't connect  
- API calls were failing

## ✅ What I Just Did:
Started the backend server for you.

```

### Step 3: Click the GO Button

## 🐛 If Still Not Working:

### Check 1: Backend Running?
Open: http://localhost:5000/api
Should show API info, not "Can't connect"

### Check 2: Console Errors?
Open browser console (F12)
Look for any **red errors**

### Check 3: Socket Connected?
Debug box should show: "Socket: ✅ Connected"

---

## ✅ Success Indicators:

✅ Debug box shows "Socket: ✅ Connected"  
✅ Debug box shows "Is Online: ✅ Yes"  
✅ Clicking GO button works (no error)  
✅ Clicking TEST POPUP shows the white popup
