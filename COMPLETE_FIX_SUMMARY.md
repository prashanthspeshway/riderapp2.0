## 🐛 If Popup Still Doesn't Appear

### Check 1: Backend Console
Look for:
```
❌ Matchmaking error: ...
```
If you see this, check what the error is.

### Check 2: Rider Console  
Look for:
```
📱📱📱 RIDE REQUEST RECEIVED!
```
- If you see this → State is set, check UI rendering
- If you DON'T see this → Socket not receiving

### Check 3: Debug Box
Look for:
- **Red box at top-left** = State is set ✅
- **No red box** = State not being set ❌

### Check 4: Socket Connection
In rider console, type:
```javascript
socket.connected // Should be true
socket.id // Should show socket ID
```
